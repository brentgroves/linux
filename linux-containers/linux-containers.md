## Container and virtualization tools

linuxcontainers.org is the umbrella project behind Incus, LXC, LXCFS, Distrobuilder and more.

The goal is to offer a distro and vendor neutral environment for the development of Linux container technologies.

Our focus is providing containers and virtual machines that run full Linux systems. While VMs supply a complete environment, system containers offer an environment as close as possible to the one you'd get from a VM, but without the overhead that comes with running a separate kernel and simulating all the hardware.
