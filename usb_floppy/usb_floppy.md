## Currently, these are the best external floppy drives

Chuanganzhuo 3.5″ USB Floppy Drive – Tried and true option that’s been selling on Amazon for over 8 years. At 0.63″ thick, it’s the thinnest option available. Comes with a USB-C adapter for connecting to newer machines.
wintale External USB 3.5″ Floppy Drive – With both Windows and Mac OS compatibility, it’s another prime pick. Although at 1.06″ thick, it’s a bit bulkier than the first option, it has a dual USB-A and USB-C cable built right into it.
Dainty External Floppy Disk Drive – Although it only has a USB-A connector, it works perfectly well on Windows and Mac machines. At 0.76″ thick, it’s still plenty portable. Also, it’s the least expensive one out of these three options.
