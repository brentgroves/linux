# **[Download the version](https://go.dev/dl/)** you want

Did not install apt go at home and only installed 1 version and updated path in exports.sh to /usr/local/go/bin

## Remove previous version and install new version

Remove any previous Go installation by deleting the /usr/local/go folder (if it exists), then extract the archive you just downloaded into /usr/local, creating a fresh Go tree in /usr/local/go:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

(You may need to run the command as root or through sudo).

Do not untar the archive into an existing /usr/local/go tree. This is known to produce broken Go installations.

## managing multiple versions

You can install multiple Go versions on the same machine. For example, you might want to test your code on multiple Go versions. For a list of versions you can install this way, see the **[download page](https://go.dev/dl/)**.

Note: To install using the method described here, you'll need to have git installed.

To install additional Go versions, run the **[go install](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies)** command, specifying the download location of the version you want to install.

```bash
# step 1 downloads the go installation program to ~/go/bin
go install golang.org/dl/go1.21.0@latest
# step 2 install the go version to the ~/sdk/go1.21.0 directory
~/go/bin/go1.21.0 download
# go version still says the previous version because the exports.sh path still points to /usr/local/bin which is the old version of go.
# to make the new version the default version you can point path variable in exports.sh to the ~/sdk/go1.21.0 directory or remove the old version from /usr/local/bin and copy the new version there and set the path to /usr/local/bin.
export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH


# To temporarily run go commands with the newly-downloaded version, append the version number to the go command, as follows:

$ ~/go/go1.21.0 version
go version go1.10.7 linux/amd64
```
