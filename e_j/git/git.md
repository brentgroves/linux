# Step 1: Update the system
# Before installing Git make sure your system is up to date. To verify this use the following commands.

sudo apt update -yq | sudo apt upgrade -yq
sudo apt install git
git --version

# Step 1: Provide a username
# Use the command given below to provide a username
# Pick only one user.name, user.email
git config --global user.name "cstangland"

git config --global user.name "sjackson"
git config --global user.name "jdavis"
git config --global user.name "kyoung"
git config --global user.name "brentgroves"

# Step 2: Provide an email address
# The email address is provided using this command.

git config --global user.email "cstangland@mobexglobal.com"

## Trouble-Shooting

### AI why does server certificate verification failed. CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

The error "server certificate verification failed. CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt" means that your system cannot verify the authenticity of the server's SSL certificate because it is either expired, self-signed, or issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is not trusted by your system's list of known CAs, which is stored in the file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.
Key reasons for this error:
Outdated CA certificates:
The most common cause is that your system's list of trusted CAs is not up-to-date, meaning the server's certificate might be signed by a CA that is no longer considered reliable.
Expired certificate:
The server's SSL certificate might have expired.
Self-signed certificate:
The server might be using a self-signed certificate, which is not trusted by default unless explicitly added to your system's trusted CA list.
Mismatched hostname:
The server's certificate might not match the hostname you are trying to access.
Network issues:
In some cases, network issues like a proxy could interfere with certificate verification

### bypass ssl verification

```bash
ssh brent@10.188.50.202
git clone https://github.com/barnybug/cli53
git clone https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git
Cloning into 'w3schools-test.github.io'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git/': server certificate verification failed. CAfile: none CRLfile: none

You can also disable SSL verification, (if the project does not require a high level of security other than login/password) by typing :

sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Indiana/Indianapolis
sudo timedatectl

git config --global --get http.sslverify 


git config --global http.sslverify false
```

### configure git to use local trust store

<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config>

```bash
2016: Make sure first that you have certificates installed on your Debian in /etc/ssl/certs.

If not, reinstall them:

sudo apt-get install --reinstall ca-certificates
Since that package does not include root certificates, add:

sudo update-ca-certificates
Make sure your git does reference those CA:

git config --global --get http.sslCAinfo

git config --global http.sslCAinfo /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

git config --global --get http.sslCAPath

git config --global http.sslCAPath /etc/ssl/certs/

http.sslCAPath

Since that package does not include root certificates, add:

sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cacert.org
sudo wget -P ~/cacert.org http://www.cacert.org/certs/root.crt http://www.cacert.org/certs/class3.crt

sudo wget -P /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cacert.org http://www.cacert.org/certs/root.crt http://www.cacert.org/certs/class3.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
Make sure your git does reference those CA:

git config --global http.sslCAinfo /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt


```

http.sslVerify
Whether to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Defaults to true. Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY environment variable.

http.sslCert
File containing the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CERT environment variable.

http.sslKey
File containing the SSL private key when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_KEY environment variable.

http.sslCertPasswordProtected
Enable Gitâ€™s password prompt for the SSL certificate. Otherwise OpenSSL will prompt the user, possibly many times, if the certificate or private key is encrypted. Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED environment variable.

http.sslCAInfo
File containing the certificates to verify the peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CAINFO environment variable.

http.sslCAPath
Path containing files with the CA certificates to verify the peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CAPATH environment variable.
