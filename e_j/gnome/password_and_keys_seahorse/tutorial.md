# **[Seahorse: Manage Your Passwords & Encryption Keys in Linux](https://itsfoss.com/seahorse/)**

## Note

This is called "Passwords and Keys" now.

Don’t worry. You don’t have to ‘fight the daemon’ in the terminal. Most desktop environments come with a graphical application that interacts with this daemon. On KDE, there is KDE Wallet, on GNOME and others, it’s called Password and Keys (originally known as Seahorse).

Brief: A simple open-source password and encryption key manager app, let’s explore what it has to offer and how you can get it installed.

We often tend to ignore many default/pre-installed applications, especially when numerous tools and utilities are baked in.

One such helpful tool that you can use on various Linux distributions is GNOME’s Seahorse.
