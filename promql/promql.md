# PromQL

PromQL is a query language for Prometheus monitoring system. It is designed for building powerful yet simple queries for graphs, alerts or derived time series (aka recording rules). PromQL is designed from scratch and has zero common grounds with other query languages used in time series databases such as SQL in TimescaleDB, InfluxQL or Flux.

This allowed creating a clear language for typical TSDB queries. But it has a cost — beginners usually need to spend a few hours reading the official PromQL docs before they understand how it works. Let’s flatten and shorten the learning curve for PromQL.
