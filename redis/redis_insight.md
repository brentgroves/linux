## RedisInsight

RedisInsight allows you to:

View data structures visually with the Browser tool and group keys according to their namespaces.
Use CRUD on most Redis Stack data structures.
Leverage Workbench, an advanced command-line interface with intelligent command auto-complete and complex data visualizations.
Analyze traffic to Redis in real time using the Profiler tool.
Use embedded Redis CLI at any time.
Analyze memory usage with the Memory Analysis tool.
Identify and troubleshoot bottlenecks using the Slowlog tool.

## Overview

Connection management
Automatically discover and add your local Redis or Redis Stack databases (that use standalone connection type and do not require authentication).
Discover your databases in Redis Enterprise Cluster and databases with Flexible plans in Redis Cloud.
Use a form to enter your connection details and add any Redis database running anywhere (including OSS Cluster, Sentinel).
