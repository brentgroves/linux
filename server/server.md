What is a Hypervisor?
Hypervisor acts as a governing mechanism. It is a software layer that allows you to create and work on many virtual machines on a single hardware unit.

A hypervisor is primarily divided into two types based on their working: Type 1 hypervisor is one that runs on the host hardware directly. These are also called as bare-metal hypervisor.

On the other hand, type 2 hypervisor runs on a software i.e. an operating system. System administrators use both types of open source hypervisor based on their specific needs.

Businesses can choose any of the two, depending upon their infrastructure and needs for managing virtualization. So here is a list of top 10 open source hypervisors, which are used by professionals.
