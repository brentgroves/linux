What is a Hypervisor?
Hypervisor acts as a governing mechanism. It is a software layer that allows you to create and work on many virtual machines on a single hardware unit.

A hypervisor is primarily divided into two types based on their working: Type 1 hypervisor is one that runs on the host hardware directly. These are also called as bare-metal hypervisor.

On the other hand, type 2 hypervisor runs on a software i.e. an operating system. System administrators use both types of open source hypervisor based on their specific needs.

Businesses can choose any of the two, depending upon their infrastructure and needs for managing virtualization. So here is a list of top 10 open source hypervisors, which are used by professionals.

Xen
Xen is among the market leaders in the open-source hypervisor arena. The Xen Project, as it is known, is licensed under GPLv2.

Like its competition, the open-source hypervisor also comes in a commercial version from Citrix and Oracle VM. It has cloud support, which includes Openstack and Cloudstack, among others.

Xen supports the virtualization of x86 IA64, ARM, among other architectures. Xen has been used in the virtualization of a wide array of guest OS. A few of the OS supported by Xen are Windows, Solaris, and other versions of the BSD OS.
