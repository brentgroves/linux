Hi. I am interested in taking data science courses and would appreciate some help with a few questions. Thank you.

- Do I have to pass any test to be eligible to take data science courses?  I received a Bachelor's degree in computer science in 93 from Chapman University. The company I work for provides tuition assistance for workers pursuing a bachelor's degree.
- Do you have any special tuition assistance programs for older returning students?
- I live about 30 miles from Fort Wayne and was wondering if I could take some classes online.

Sincerely yours,
Brent
