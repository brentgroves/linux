# Father's will

If you believe that I want you to attend college then do.  I love you my son and have a plan for you.  What you think is important may not be what I desire for you.  Remember that I control each situation and will allow what you may think of as a bad thing happen to you for your own greater good.  But don't stop believing that I always have your best interests in mind no matter how bad your situation may seem to you.  And do not forget that you must wait upon my timing for everything.  Just because I want you to do something does not mean that it is going to happen right away.  You must learn patience as you constantly seek my will for your life.  But do not fear because I have many good and wonderous things for you to experience, and we will experience each one together.  Do not forget that I love you and am always with you!
