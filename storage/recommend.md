# Storage Types

There are many storage solutions but I would recommend object based storage in most cases.

## Object storage

- Can be managed locally at no cost with **[](https://min.io/)**
- Just upload your files and download them from anywhere
- Can be managed through our cloud provider

Benefits of **[Azure Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction)**

Azure Storage services offer the following benefits for application developers and IT professionals:

- Durable and highly available. Redundancy ensures that your data is safe in the event of transient hardware failures. You can also opt to replicate data across data centers or geographical regions for additional protection from local catastrophe or natural disaster. Data replicated in this way remains highly available in the event of an unexpected outage.
- Secure. All data written to an Azure storage account is encrypted by the service. Azure Storage provides you with fine-grained control over who has access to your data.
- Scalable. Azure Storage is designed to be massively scalable to meet the data storage and performance needs of today's applications.
Managed. Azure handles hardware maintenance, updates, and critical issues for you.
- Accessible. Data in Azure Storage is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Microsoft provides client libraries for Azure Storage in a variety of languages, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go, and others, as well as a mature REST API. Azure Storage supports scripting in Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI. And the Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer offer easy visual solutions for working with your data.
