# OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework for infrastructure instrumentation hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). The project gained a lot of momentum with contributions from all major cloud providers (AWS, Google, Microsoft) as well as observability vendors (including Timescale) to the point it became the second-highest ranked CNCF project by activity and contributors, only coming second to Kubernetes itself.
