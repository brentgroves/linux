## What is Incus

Incus (a fork of LXD) is a container and virtual-machine manager.
Based on LXC for containers and QEMU for virtual machines, it offers a seamless cloud-like experience scaling from a developer's laptop to a full cluster of up to 50 servers.
In addition to managing containers and VMs, Incus also provides a variety of options to manage storage and network.
