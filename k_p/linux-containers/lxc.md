# LXC

LXC is a well-known Linux container runtime that consists of tools, templates, and library and language bindings. It's pretty low level, very flexible and covers just about every containment feature supported by the upstream kernel.

## Features

Proxmox VE is an open-source server virtualization platform to manage two virtualization technologies: Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) for virtual machines and LXC for containers - with a single web-based interface.[11] It also integrates out-of-the-box-tools for configuring high availability between servers, software-defined storage, networking, and disaster recovery.[17]

Proxmox VE supports live migration for guest machines between nodes in the scope of a single cluster, which allows smooth migration without interrupting their services.[18] Since PVE 7.3 there is experimental feature for migration between unrelated nodes in different clusters.[19]

PVE can be integrated with LDAP and ActiveDirectory servers.[20]

Guest machines backup can be done using included standalone vzdump tool.[21] PVE can be also integrated with separate machine Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) using web GUI[22] or with text based Proxmox Backup Client application.[23]

Since PVE 8 along with standard GUI installer there's a semi-graphic (TUI) installer integrated into the ISO image.[20]
