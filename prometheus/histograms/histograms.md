Some libraries support only one of the two types, or they support summaries only in a limited fashion (lacking quantile calculation).

This blog post assumes you are familiar with the different types of metric Prometheus has to offer and are aware of the fact that real-time, dynamic values can be measured using histograms or summaries.
