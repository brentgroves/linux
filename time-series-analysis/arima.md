## About X-13

X-13ARIMA-SEATS is seasonal adjustment software produced, distributed, and maintained by the Census Bureau.

Features of X-13ARIMA-SEATS include:

- Extensive time series modeling and model selection capabilities for linear regression models with ARIMA errors (regARIMA models);
- The capability to generate ARIMA model-based seasonal adjustment using a version of the SEATS software originally developed by Victor Gómez and Agustín Maravall at the Bank of Spain, as well as nonparametric adjustments from the X-11 procedure;
- Diagnostics of the quality and stability of the adjustments achieved under the options selected;
-The ability to efficiently process many series at once.

This site contains distributions of X-13ARIMA-SEATS for Windows® PC and Linux/Unix platforms, along with multiple utility programs to assist in running the program:

- Win X-13 is an interface program for running X-13ARIMA-SEATS in Windows.
- X-13-Data provides an interface between X-13ARIMA-SEATS and Excel.
- X-13-Graph allows users to generate useful graphical diagnostics from X-13ARIMA-SEATS output. Two versions of the program are available: an interactive Java version and a SAS/Graph® version that can create graphs in batch.
- X-13-SAM lets users quickly make changes to many X-13ARIMA-SEATS input (specification) files at one time.
- Win Genhol generates user-defined moving holiday regressors.
